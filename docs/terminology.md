# Terminology

## Fixed timestep

A tick is the same thing as a fixed update.

## Worlds

"Save files" are organised as "game instances" in the code, which contain "Concord worlds" called "sub-worlds".
Concord is the ECS library being used.
It would not have been done quite like this if Concord called them instances or something.
